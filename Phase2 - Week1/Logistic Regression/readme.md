## Logistic Regression

You have learned about Linear Regression and seen how it's implemented using Scikit Learn. Now we will shift out attention towards `Logistic Regression`.

Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that classifies between two linearly seprabale classes.

**What is linearly seprabale class ?**
<br>
We say they're separable if there's a classifier whose decision boundary separates the positive objects from the negative ones. If such a decision boundary is a linear function of the features, we say that the classes are linearly separable.

Logistic Regression is one of key algorithm in the class of `linear classifiers`. In the case of linear regression we took our input x and

** Softmax Regression**

As you read earlier, logistic regression is used in the case of binary classification i.e. for two classes only. Softmax Regression is an extension to it
and is also known as multinomial logistic regression.
