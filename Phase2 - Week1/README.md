# CONGRATS!! On coming so far.
# Welcome to PHASE 2 of Robotics Summer Camp.
#### Let's dive into Machine Learning and Neural Networks. This week has been divided into subparts wherein you will start with basic machine learning algorithms and get into neural networks to discover and unleash the power of ML/AI in robotics and other domains as well.

- `Introduction To Machine learning`

- `Linear Regression`

- `Logistic Regression`

- `Neural Networks`

## Task Announcement
The task for this week is in form of a colab notebook in the neural network section. You won't use linear or logistic regression right now. 
But don't skip on it, you will enconter it in the next week.
